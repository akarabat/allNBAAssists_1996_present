# allNBAAssists_1996_present
A dataset of every assist in the NBA since basketball-reference.com began tracking play-by-play data (1996-1997 season) with some programs to recreate the data and play with it

raw dataset not currently available. Too large for Github and its throwing me some weird errors that I don't understand yet. Will update.

The raw dataset is reproducable from the programs, but it can over 2 hours to run
